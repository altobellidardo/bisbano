    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>
      I am a dedicated programmer with basis in various programming languages, such as, C,<br>
      Python, HTML5, CSS, JavaScript. As an electronic technician I understand computers and<br>
      know what we, as programmers should do to have the most optimized and non destructive codes that exist nowadays
    </p>

    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <p>
      My high school formation was innovative and we were taught via projects, so<br>
      I have lots of experience in them. I am a team player, if there is not a clear boss<br>
      around I will be taking on the responsibility. However, I am aware of my limitations<br>
      so I am willing to take a seat back and learn from my bosses or
      how I like to call<br> them, my mentors.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>Simon Says (2019)</h3>
        <p>
          As I already knew the basics of programming when I entered E.T.R.R. I was incentivized to continue
          to learn even new languages, this is when a friend and I started learning C and made a randomized
          Simon Says on the second grade (13 years old) that was presentend on the 2019 TedEd Talks. We had
          a lot of positive feedback.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Basketball Hoop (2020)</h3>
        <p>
          Before the Pandemic started I was starting to like basketball and when it exploded and we, in
          Argentina, were quaratined. I knew I had to do something to continue my formation.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>TedEd Talk</h3>
        <p>
          In my school we had the chance to do a Ted Talk on the 4th year. I had bad luck and did them
          online. However, it was also nerve racking. I talked about if obstacles were possibilities
          of opportunities, using the example of the basketball hoop i just had finished a few months prior.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>N.A.R.F. (2021)</h3>
        <p>
          With my closests friends we decided to make a knockoff NERF as they are expensive and we were
          seeing in class the posibilities of electronics, such as CC motors, we used the basics and did
          it.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>NewVision (2022)</h3>
        <p>
          At the end of the Global Pandemic we all saw the limitations disabled people had in our day to
          day world, specially in that period of time blind people. This is why we did an electronic device
          that consisted in three stages, the first one was the sensors, then there was the processing that
          was made by a discrete electronic circuit and the final part that was the one that warned the user
          that there was possible danger ahead. This project was done with the help of A.S.A.C. (Asociacion
          Argentina de Ciegos)
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Basketball Scoreboard (2023)</h3>
        <p>
          With some friends we had the idea of our school hosting various sporting events. We were all keen
          on basketball and our school court only had one big thing missing, that is the actual ability to
          keep track of how the game was on points, so we decided to take on the challenge.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Ecodesafio (2023)</h3>
        <p>
          I took part on the Y.P.F. Ecodesafio in 2023 as a member of the electronics division.
          Here I learned how to be part of a big team, in our division we were just three members that
          developed a system that told us whether to accelerate or deaccelerate depending on the
          battery left on the car. I worked in the sensors circuits and the power electronics while my
          coworkers worked on a neurological network that used the data I recolected.
